Spatio-temporal Analysis of Twitter Data Streams

This project is running at: http://www.geotweetsearch.org.

This was originally coded as part of a University project and took 1 year to develop; the report for this can be found here:

This project was originally in SVN and was not migrated properly, hence the lack of commit history.
